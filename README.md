## Guardian Nodes üõ°Ô∏è

Sitting above the PoP nodes, Guardian Nodes act like watchdogs. They continuously monitor network health, gather telemetry data, and optimize routing to ensure users get the fastest and most reliable data paths.

## How it Works üîç

Guardian Nodes collect real-time metrics like latency, bandwidth, and uptime from PoP nodes.
With these insights, they can reroute traffic dynamically to avoid bottlenecks, improving overall network performance. üöÄ
